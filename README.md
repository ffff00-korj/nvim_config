# About

My personal NeoVim configuration (minimalistic version), written in lua. It contains:
* Lazy (greatest neovim package manager)
* Custom bindings
* Treesitter for cool highlights
* Lsp and lsp config (pyright and luals)
* Git plugins and Undotree to work with changes
* Python, Golang, Lua lsp setup with python venv, Linters and format on save
* VSCode theme

```sh
# run NeoVim
nvim .

# type ':Lazy' abd 'I' to install plugins (it will be uploaded from github)
```
